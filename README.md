# Python-Bootcamp-Capstone-Project-1-Pig-Latin
This is the first part of my capstone projects in Jose Portilla's Python bootcamp

For this project we were asked to create an application that we believed we could finish in a day and one that we could finish in a week. 

This part of my project was done in a few hours - I chose to make an application that takes in a sentence and returns that sentence translated into pig-latin.
